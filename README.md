# DATASET VALIDATION AGENT 

This project is a **read-only agent** that inspects **tabular datasets**, identifies issues, and produces a structured report. The agent **does not modify the dataset** — it only detects and reports problems.

#### Motivation
Data is the backbone of modern AI systems, but even small inconsistencies, missing values, or duplicates can break downstream models. Cleaning datasets manually is slow and error-prone.  

This agent provides a **safe, local-first solution** to quickly assess dataset quality before any modeling or fine-tuning. It is lightweight, practical, and designed for real-world ML pipelines.

- The agent is business-agnostic.
- It can be integrated into existing pipelines or used standalone.
- It Currently focuses on tabular datasets.
- Future updates may expand capabilities into other dataset modalities.




> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is under active development. The agent currently only detects and reports issues; it does not modify the dataset.
